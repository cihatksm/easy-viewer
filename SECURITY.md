## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or declined, etc.

To report a vulnerability, please visit our support website at cihatksm.com.
We take full responsibility for all rights and ensure continuous support throughout the process.
Once you submit a vulnerability, you can expect regular updates on its status.
If the vulnerability is accepted, appropriate actions will be taken to address it.
If it is declined, we will provide an explanation. Thank you for your cooperation.
